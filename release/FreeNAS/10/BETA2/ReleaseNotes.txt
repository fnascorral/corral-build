Thank you for downloading FreeNAS 10-BETA2!

This build was created on November 21st, 2016 - a key milestone date in
FreeNAS 10 reaching full "feature complete" (but not yet bug free!) status.

569 tickets were resolved between BETA and BETA2 (see
https://bugs.freenas.org/projects/freenas-10/issues?query_id=262
for a full list).

What's new in BETA2 since BETA (big ticket features only)

o	FreeNAS 10 should now be at feature-parity with FreeNAS 9.10.  Not all
	features are implemented in precisely the same way, but there should
	not be anything (modulo bugs) that you can do with 9.10 but cannot
	do with 10-BETA2. 

o	Docker container support finialized, "Docker container collections"
	created as 1st class citizens in order to reduce the 100,000+
	Docker images on dockerhub to more manageable proportions and a
	"freenas" collection created to both recreate the 9.10 plugins as
	Docker containers and provide extra metadata for making setup and
	configuration of Containers easier.

o	Calendar UI now supports all task types and has been massively improved
	over BETA.

o	Windows Domain Controller is now provided, mostly transparently,
	by a Zentyal VM which also offers Microsoft Exchange Server
	functionality.

o	All directory services fully supported (Active Directory, LDAP,
	NIS, FreeIPA) and integrated from the Unix-layer upwards (so even
	shell commands will respect directory service bindings and search
	order preferences).

o	Firefox and Microsoft Edge added to "list of browsers to try to use
	with FreeNAS 10" - please try these (in addition to Chrome) and file
	tickets if anything looks or acts oddly.
